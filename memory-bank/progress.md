# Progress: EPUB Quote Extractor

## What Works

*   **Revised Two-Stage Processing Pipeline:** The full, two-stage pipeline for quote extraction, approval, and grouping has been implemented with a revised workflow.
*   **Stage 1: Extraction:**
    *   **Core Application Orchestration (`main.py`):** Handles argument parsing, EPUB processing, LLM interaction, and database saving. Now includes `overlap_size` argument and **integrates progress tracking for resume/pause functionality.**
*   **Stage 2: Approval & Grouping (Revised Workflow):**
    *   **Approval Handler (`approval_handler.py`):** Orchestrates the second-stage processing. It now prioritizes grouping all `PENDING` quotes first.
    *   **Approval Prompts (`approval_prompts.py`):** Contains the prompts for LLM-powered approval and grouping, with the approval prompt now specifically tailored for ungrouped quotes.
    *   **CLI Trigger (`main.py`):** The `--run-approval` flag in `main.py` successfully triggers this revised approval process.
*   **Database Schema (`schemas.py`):** The schema has been updated with `QuoteApproval`, `QuoteGroup`, and `QuoteToGroup` tables, along with the necessary relationships.
*   **Database Logic (`database.py`):** The `save_quotes_to_db` function now correctly creates a `PENDING` approval record for each new quote.
*   **Memory Bank Initialized & Updated:** The foundational documentation has been created and updated to reflect the current codebase.
*   **Core Application Orchestration (`main.py`):** Handles argument parsing, EPUB processing, LLM interaction, and database saving. Now includes `overlap_size` argument and **integrates progress tracking for resume/pause functionality.**
*   **Database Schema (`schemas.py`):** The schema has been updated with `QuoteApproval`, `QuoteGroup`, and `QuoteToGroup` tables, along with the necessary relationships.
*   **Database Logic (`database.py`):** The `save_quotes_to_db` function now correctly creates a `PENDING` approval record for each new quote.
*   **Memory Bank Initialized & Updated:** The foundational documentation has been created and updated to reflect the current codebase.
*   **Core Application Orchestration (`main.py`):** Handles argument parsing, EPUB processing, LLM interaction, and database saving. Now includes `overlap_size` argument and **integrates progress tracking for resume/pause functionality.**
*   **EPUB Parsing (`epub_parser.py`):** Extracts text by chapter/section using `ebooklib` and `BeautifulSoup`. Now includes chunking with configurable `overlap_size` (default 200 chars).
*   **LLM Interaction (`llm_handler.py`):** Integrates with Google Gemini API, enforces model whitelisting, configures structured JSON output, and includes retry mechanisms and robust response parsing.
*   **Prompt Engineering (`prompts.py`):** Dynamically incorporates Pydantic schema into LLM prompts, with detailed multilingual and JSON formatting instructions.
*   **Data Models (`schemas.py`):** Defines Pydantic (`QuoteLLM`) and SQLAlchemy (`QuoteDB`) models. `QuoteDB` now includes a `UniqueConstraint` on `epub_source_identifier` and `quote_text`. **A new `ProgressDB` model is added for tracking processing progress.**
*   **Database Connection & Saving (`database.py`):** Configures SQLAlchemy for PostgreSQL (with SQLite fallback). `save_quotes_to_db` now uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for PostgreSQL inserts. **New functions `save_progress`, `load_progress`, and `clear_progress` are implemented for managing processing state.**

## What's Left to Build

*   **Environment Setup:** The Python virtual environment needs to be activated and all dependencies from `requirements.txt` installed.
*   **Database Migration Setup:** Alembic needs to be initialized and configured to manage the new schema changes (`QuoteApproval`, `QuoteGroup`, `QuoteToGroup`).
*   **LLM Prompt Optimization:** The prompts in both `prompts.py` and `approval_prompts.py` can be further refined to improve accuracy.
*   **EPUB Page Number Refinement:** Continue to investigate and implement more precise page number extraction from EPUBs, or enhance the `epub_source_identifier` if possible, as the current implementation relies on section IDs.
*   **LLM Prompt Optimization:** Further fine-tune the LLM prompts to improve extraction accuracy, especially for diverse EPUB content and complex quote structures.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Enhance error handling across all modules, particularly for edge cases in EPUB parsing (e.g., malformed EPUBs), LLM response failures, and database integrity issues.
*   **Testing:** Develop a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability and correctness of the entire pipeline.
*   **CLI Enhancements:** Improve the command-line interface for better user experience, including progress indicators, verbose logging options, and potentially more input options.

## Current Status

The project now features a complete, two-stage, LLM-powered pipeline for quote extraction and processing with a revised workflow. The first stage extracts quotes from EPUBs and stores them in a database with a `PENDING` status. The second stage first attempts to group all pending quotes, marking grouped quotes as `APPROVED`. Any remaining ungrouped quotes are then individually evaluated by an LLM for final approval or declination (specifically, isolated Quranic ayahs are declined). The database schema, application logic, and command-line interface have all been updated to support this new architecture. The immediate next steps are to set up the environment, run database migrations to apply the new schema, and then begin testing and refining the new pipeline.

## Known Issues

*   None at this very early stage. Potential issues will be identified during implementation and testing.
