# Progress: EPUB Quote Extractor

## What Works

*   **Memory Bank Initialized:** The foundational documentation for the project has been successfully created and organized.
*   **Core Application Orchestration (`main.py`):** The main script is structured to handle argument parsing, EPUB processing, LLM interaction, and database saving. It integrates all other modules.
*   **EPUB Parsing (`epub_parser.py`):** Basic text extraction from EPUBs by chapter/section is implemented using `ebooklib` and `BeautifulSoup`. Text chunking is also in place.
*   **LLM Interaction (`llm_handler.py`):** Integration with Google Gemini API is set up, including API key handling, model whitelisting, structured JSON output configuration, retry mechanisms, and basic response parsing/sanitization.
*   **Prompt Engineering (`prompts.py`):** A detailed LLM prompt template is defined, dynamically incorporating the Pydantic schema for structured output and explicitly instructing on multilingual requirements and JSON formatting for `additional_info`.
*   **Data Models (`schemas.py`):** Pydantic (`QuoteLLM`) and SQLAlchemy (`QuoteDB`) models are defined, ensuring structured data for both LLM output validation and database persistence. The `additional_info` field is correctly modeled to handle JSON strings with `surah` and `quote_translation`.
*   **Database Connection & Saving (`database.py`):** SQLAlchemy is configured for PostgreSQL connection (with SQLite fallback). Functions for creating tables and saving quotes in batches are implemented.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Environment Setup:** The Python virtual environment needs to be activated and all dependencies from `requirements.txt` installed.
*   **Database Migration Setup:** Alembic needs to be initialized and configured to manage schema changes for the `QuoteDB` model.
*   **EPUB Page Number Refinement:** Investigate and implement more precise page number extraction from EPUBs, or enhance the `epub_source_identifier` if possible, as the current implementation relies on section IDs.
*   **LLM Prompt Optimization:** Further fine-tune the LLM prompts to improve extraction accuracy, especially for diverse EPUB content and complex quote structures.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Enhance error handling across all modules, particularly for edge cases in EPUB parsing (e.g., malformed EPUBs), LLM response failures, and database integrity issues.
*   **Testing:** Develop a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability and correctness of the entire pipeline.
*   **CLI Enhancements:** Improve the command-line interface for better user experience, including progress indicators, verbose logging options, and potentially more input options.

## Current Status

The project has a solid foundational implementation for its core components: EPUB parsing, LLM interaction with structured outputs, and database persistence. The data models and prompt engineering are well-defined. The next immediate steps involve setting up the development environment, configuring database migrations, and then focusing on refining existing components and adding comprehensive testing.

## Known Issues

*   None at this very early stage. Potential issues will be identified during implementation and testing.
