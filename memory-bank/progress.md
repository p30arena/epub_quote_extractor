# Progress: EPUB Quote Extractor

## What Works

*   **Memory Bank Initialized & Updated:** The foundational documentation has been created and updated to reflect the current codebase.
*   **Core Application Orchestration (`main.py`):** Handles argument parsing, EPUB processing, LLM interaction, and database saving. Now includes `overlap_size` argument and **integrates progress tracking for resume/pause functionality.**
*   **EPUB Parsing (`epub_parser.py`):** Extracts text by chapter/section using `ebooklib` and `BeautifulSoup`. Now includes chunking with configurable `overlap_size` (default 200 chars).
*   **LLM Interaction (`llm_handler.py`):** Integrates with Google Gemini API, enforces model whitelisting, configures structured JSON output, and includes retry mechanisms and robust response parsing.
*   **Prompt Engineering (`prompts.py`):** Dynamically incorporates Pydantic schema into LLM prompts, with detailed multilingual and JSON formatting instructions.
*   **Data Models (`schemas.py`):** Defines Pydantic (`QuoteLLM`) and SQLAlchemy (`QuoteDB`) models. `QuoteDB` now includes a `UniqueConstraint` on `epub_source_identifier` and `quote_text`. **A new `ProgressDB` model is added for tracking processing progress.**
*   **Database Connection & Saving (`database.py`):** Configures SQLAlchemy for PostgreSQL (with SQLite fallback). `save_quotes_to_db` now uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for PostgreSQL inserts. **New functions `save_progress`, `load_progress`, and `clear_progress` are implemented for managing processing state.**

## What's Left to Build

*   **Environment Setup:** The Python virtual environment needs to be activated and all dependencies from `requirements.txt` installed.
*   **Database Migration Setup:** Alembic needs to be initialized and configured to manage schema changes for the `QuoteDB` and `ProgressDB` models. This is crucial for applying the new unique constraint and the `progress` table to the database.
*   **EPUB Page Number Refinement:** Continue to investigate and implement more precise page number extraction from EPUBs, or enhance the `epub_source_identifier` if possible, as the current implementation relies on section IDs.
*   **LLM Prompt Optimization:** Further fine-tune the LLM prompts to improve extraction accuracy, especially for diverse EPUB content and complex quote structures.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Enhance error handling across all modules, particularly for edge cases in EPUB parsing (e.g., malformed EPUBs), LLM response failures, and database integrity issues.
*   **Testing:** Develop a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability and correctness of the entire pipeline.
*   **CLI Enhancements:** Improve the command-line interface for better user experience, including progress indicators, verbose logging options, and potentially more input options.

## Current Status

The project has a robust foundational implementation for its core components, including EPUB parsing with overlap, LLM interaction with structured outputs, database persistence with duplicate prevention, and **now includes a mechanism for persisting and resuming processing progress.** The data models and prompt engineering are well-defined. The immediate next steps involve setting up the development environment, configuring database migrations, and then focusing on refining existing components and adding comprehensive testing.

## Known Issues

*   None at this very early stage. Potential issues will be identified during implementation and testing.
